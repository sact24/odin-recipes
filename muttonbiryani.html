    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mutton biryani is a popular Indian rice dish made using long grain basmati rice layered with a spicy mutton (goat meat) layer. You can also alternatively make it with lamb. 
        It is flavorful, delicious, and will make you wipe your plates clean with its 
        incredible taste and beautiful aroma!</p>
<p> There are multiple regions in India that make mutton biryani in
     their own traditional ways: Hyderabadi, Lucknowi, Dindigul, Ambur, 
     Kolkata, Thalassery, to name a few. Hyderabadi mutton biryani is the most 
     popular among all these styles and also my favorite</p>
